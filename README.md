# Discoteca

Hello !

A project to put into practice different concepts of the Android Architecture Components / Android Jetpack and other API / libraries, written in Kotlin :

CameraX<br/>
DataStore<br/>
Data binding<br/>
Discogs<br/>
Glide<br/>
Google Drive Api<br/>
Google Sign-in<br/>
Lifecycle-aware components<br/>
Material design<br/>
Mlkit barcode scanning<br/>
Moshi<br/>
Navigation<br/>
Paging 3<br/>
RecyclerView<br/>
Retrofit2<br/>
Room<br/>
Splashscreen<br/>
Timber<br/>
View binding<br/>

*******************

The purpose of the app is to be able to constitute, visualize and record its collection of musical media (CD, vinyl, cassette) in its mobile phone and/or Google Drive.</br>

--- General principle --- <br/>
A musical media can have a barcode <br/>
Three ways to record your music media : <br/>
* Read barcode with in-app reader -> Discogs Api -> result -> save in app
* Do a search with media info -> Discogs -> result -> save in app
* Add the media directly to the application with its info

Thanks you !
